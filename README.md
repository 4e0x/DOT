# DOT :tw-26ab:
DOT is a mini and very basic PHP/MySQL web application that is built to be vulnerable :tw-1f528:. This app was just built to give an insight/train beginners in the field of cyber sec to test thier skills, practice and learn how different attacks work or to get you hyped on challenges. DOT app was built for beginners but can also be used by professionals (must be really easy!).

I was inspired by [DVWA](http://dvwa.co.uk):tw-1f525: and i built a very similar but much basic and simpler app. Initial release of DOT comes with a mixture of basic, medium & high challenges taken from various platform.

### Challenges :tw-1f5fb:
Few challenges are very easy and some require you to think (ps: not breaking your head). There is no fixed way to complete the challenges it all depends on you and you only. If you are good at Cryptography go ahead and complete that first. The only aim is to give you an insight on how different attacks work or just to get you hyped on challenges.


### Warning :tw-26a0:
DOT is damn vulnerable. Please do not expose it to the internet :tw-1f6ab:. It is recommended to host it internally if you are training/hosting a competition using DOT.

### Disclaimer
I do not take responsibility for any damage caused by DOT. This was built for a purpose and should adhere to the specific. If your public web server is compromised it is not my responsibility, it simply means you have skipped the WARNING :tw-26a0: Part.
