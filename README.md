# DOT
DOT is a mini and very basic PHP/MySQL web application that is built to be vulnerable. This app was just built to give an insight/train beginners in the field of cyber sec to test thier skills, practice and learn how different attacks work or to get you hyped on challenges. DOT app was built for beginners but can also be used by professionals (must be really easy!).

I was inspired by [DVWA](http://dvwa.co.uk) and i built a very similar but much basic and simpler app. Initial release of DOT comes with a mixture of basic, medium & high challenges taken from various platform.
